### Verified project status

As of this revision, the site is a working static public-interest portal for civic awareness in the Hardoi / Behandar / Badagaon area. It includes:

- a Hindi-first landing page with legal disclaimer and civic notice ticker,
- a rights and legal education section with plain-language explanations,
- scheme cards for major public welfare schemes,
- a public directory for emergency and local public-service contacts,
- a booth finder tied to static ward-to-booth data,
- a local-only grievance draft tool that never uploads complaint text,
- and a static deploy pipeline on GitHub Pages.

### Legal and privacy posture

The project intentionally maintains a non-government, non-official, educational framing. The current build states clearly that it is:

- a private initiative,
- not an official government website,
- not legal advice,
- not a backend complaint filing service,
- and not a tracker / analytics / cookie-based site.

The current state is consistent with the project’s public-interest model: general information only, verified against official portals where possible, and presented with explicit caution before action is taken.

## Legal, privacy, and data policy

- Independent / non-government disclaimer on every page; first-visit modal on the home page.
- No Ashoka Chakra or official government branding.
- External links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Do not commit voter rolls, EPIC lists, Aadhaar, complaint text, or API keys.
- The grievance tool **only prepares a draft in the browser**. Users paste it themselves on [jansunwai.up.nic.in](https://jansunwai.up.nic.in).
- This portal does not guarantee that any complaint or application will be accepted or resolved.

---

## Known gaps (honest)

- Several local contacts (sachiv, lekhpal, tubewell, ANM) are still “जानकारी उपलब्ध नहीं”.
- Scheme amounts, eligibility, and legal text can go stale; they must be re-checked against official sites before each public update.

## Content maintenance

Before each release, review official portals, helplines, scheme rules, and local numbers. GitHub Pages is public: every committed file can be downloaded. The maintainer is responsible for correcting errors and removing data that should not be public.
